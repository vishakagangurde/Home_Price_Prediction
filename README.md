# Home Price Prediction

This project predicts home prices using machine learning techniques in Python.

## Overview
The notebook (`Home_prize_prediction.ipynb`) loads a dataset of home features, performs exploratory data analysis (EDA), preprocesses the data, and trains a machine learning model to predict house prices.

## Features
- Data preprocessing using **pandas** and **NumPy**
- Visualization with **matplotlib** and **seaborn**
- Model training and evaluation using **scikit-learn**
- Interactive experimentation in Jupyter Notebook

## Requirements
Install dependencies from `requirements.txt`:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage
1. Clone this repository or download the files.
2. Install dependencies.
3. Open the notebook in Jupyter:
```bash
jupyter notebook Home_prize_prediction.ipynb
```
4. Run all cells to train the model and view predictions.

## Dataset
The dataset should contain features of houses (e.g., number of rooms, location, area) and target prices. Update the notebook path to point to your dataset file.

## Output
The model outputs predicted home prices for given input features.
